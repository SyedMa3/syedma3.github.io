# Hi there! 👋 I'm Mateen.

Welcome to my little corner on the web. I'm a 4th year CS undergrad @ [IIT Palakkad](https://iitpkd.ac.in/) who loves building and learning about great backend systems. My areas of interest(experience) are backend development, Computer Vision, AI(every new interesting research).

## Past Experiences

- **Software Intern @ [Arista](https://www.arista.com/en/)**: Worked on Arista CloudVision, a modern, multi-domain management platform for NetOps. Developed a new feature which got pushed to production.

- **AI Intern @ [Detect Technologies](https://detecttechnologies.com/)**: Worked on developing a generative model to convert synthetic data to real data for training AI models.

- **Technical Affairs Secretary @ [IIT Palakkad](https://iitpkd.ac.in/)**: Responsible for managing the tech culture at IIT Palakkad. Improved the culture by introducing semester-long club projects. Created a student handled tech space which consists state of the art equipment (and two bean bags 😆).

## What I Know/Skills

I thrive on turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive solutions. My toolbox includes:

- **Languages:** Python, Go, Javascript, C++, C
- **Frameworks:** Django, Express
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- **DevOps:** Docker, CI/CD pipelines
- **Version Control:** Git

## Outside of Coding

When I'm not behind a computer screen, I'm probably:

- Trying to add new unrelated non-technical skills to my skillset 🧑‍🎨
- Playing online multiplayer games 🎮
- Reading about the latest tech trends 📖
